A Flappy Bird clone. 

Powered by [raylib](<https://www.raylib.com/>)

## Goals

To learn about game dev in C.

## Building

1. Ensure that you have CMake installed and that it is at least version 3.20.
2. From the root directory of this project, create a new directory called `build` and change directories into it.
3. From the command line, call `cmake ..`. If **raylib** has not been installed already, it will clone it and include its `CMakeLists.txt` into the build process of this project.
4. Run the `FlappyBinChicken` executable from `build` directory you created.
